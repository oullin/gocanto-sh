Structured around clean request routing, strict input validation, and a fixture-driven data layer that makes it trivial to swap persistence backends without touching application logic. Designed from the start for predictable latency under load, with no hidden allocations in the hot path. Ships as a single Docker image with zero external config requirements — pull, run, done.",

      "excerpt": "The Vue 3 + TypeScript single-page application behind the Oullin platform. Built with Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, and a composable API store that abstracts all remote data access behind a single, type-safe surface. Routing, SEO metadata, and structured JSON-LD are handled declaratively so each page remains focused on content rather than plumbing. shadcn-vue provides the base component primitives, extended with a custom design token system for light and dark mode without a single media query in component code.",

      "excerpt": "Docker-based deployment pipeline for the full Oullin stack — API, web client, and any future services. The core design principle is environment parity: if it works locally it works in production, with no special-casing at any layer. A composable Makefile wraps common operations so the cognitive overhead of managing multi-service deployments collapses to a handful of muscle-memory commands. Reproducible builds are enforced through pinned base images and explicit dependency resolution.",

Transitions are declared explicitly with guard conditions and side-effect hooks, making illegal state changes impossible by construction rather than by convention. The engine ships with a full audit trail, thread-safe concurrent state lookups, and Graphviz export for visualising transition graphs — useful both in debugging and in communicating system behaviour to non-technical stakeholders.",

The backend is a Laravel API managing user profiles, session history, and content delivery. The frontend is a Vue SPA with a visual language intentionally distinct from the productivity tools I usually build — softer, more tactile, more human. The project was as much a study in product thinking and user empathy as it was a technical exercise.",

The project also served as the testbed where I first established the design token system, composable SEO utilities, and API store patterns that later carried forward into the Oullin platform.",

The goal was to make generating a multi-page, branded document feel as unremarkable as rendering an HTML response.

At the time of release, Vue's built-in event system didn't scale well beyond simple parent-child communication — vuemit filled that gap with a clean subscribe/publish API that worked across component trees without forcing a full state management solution. Shipped to npm and used in production across multiple client engagements where the overhead of Vuex was unjustifiable for the problem size.",

The component exposes individual address fields — street, city, postcode, country — as distinct mapped outputs rather than forcing consumers to parse a raw Places response themselves. Country restrictions, field mappings, and bias regions are all configurable via props. Addresses the common pain point where Google's SDK API and Vue's reactivity model pull in opposite directions, resolving that tension with a thin but principled adapter layer.",

Conversion operations are expressed as value types rather than primitive floats, eliminating a whole class of precision and mutation bugs at the type level. The port mirrors the design decisions made in the earlier PHP version of the same library — intentionally, to validate that the interface held up across languages and runtime models.",

Wraps Guzzle behind a consistent interface that adds configurable retry logic with backoff, structured request and response logging, and dynamic header injection for auth token propagation. The abstraction was motivated by recurring client work where teams were duplicating the same retry-and-log boilerplate across every service boundary — this library makes the right behaviour the default.",

Conversion amounts are wrapped in typed value objects that carry currency context, making invalid operations fail at the method boundary rather than silently producing wrong numbers. The library predates the Go port and established the interface design that was later validated in that second implementation.",

Contributions included fixing subtle behavioural inconsistencies in request input handling, improving API surface consistency in the router, and tightening documentation where the specified and actual behaviour had drifted apart. Contributing to a codebase used by millions of developers demands a different standard of care than internal work: every change is load-bearing for someone else's production system.",
